# nix-mox: Proxmox, NixOS, & Windows Automation

Terse, reproducible, and opinionated automation for Proxmox, NixOS, and Windows.

This repository provides a set of scripts, NixOS modules, and templates to streamline the management of a home server environment running Proxmox, with a focus on declarative systems using NixOS and automated setups for Windows VMs.

## üåü Features

- **üöÄ Nix-Powered Automation**:
  - Run scripts for Proxmox maintenance (`proxmox-update`), ZFS snapshots (`zfs-snapshot`), and backups (`vzdump-backup`) directly with `nix run`.
  - Update your NixOS systems with a single command: `nix run .#nixos-flake-update`.
  - Use the included NixOS module to make all scripts and a daily flake update service available system-wide.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Windows VM Automation**:
  - Automate Steam and Rust installation on a Windows VM using a NuShell script, perfect for setting up gaming VMs.
  - Deploy the automation to run on user login with a pre-configured Windows Scheduled Task.
- **üìÇ Declarative Templates**:
  - Deploy NixOS as a lightweight LXC container or a fully declarative VM.
  - Examples for ZFS caching, Docker/LXC containers, and Grafana monitoring dashboards.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Developer Environment**:
  - Get a consistent and reproducible development environment with `nix develop`, which provides all the tools needed to work on this repository.

## About

nix-mox provides automation scripts and templates for:

- Proxmox host management
- NixOS system updates and deployment
- Windows automation (Steam, Rust, etc.)
- Container and monitoring templates

It leverages Nix Flakes for easy script execution (e.g., `nix run .#proxmox-update`) and a consistent development environment (`nix develop`).
